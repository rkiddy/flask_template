# flask_template

I have now created several of these applications and so now I am starting to just remember
how to do them. But that is also dangerous. That means that muscle-memory might be taking
over.

So, here I am documenting the why and where-fors of setting these applications up so that I
have some idea of why I am doing things this way.

Any comments are fair game. Any use is at your discretion.
